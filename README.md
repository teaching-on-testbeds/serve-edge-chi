# Serving machine learning models on edge devices

In a [previous experiment](https://teaching-on-testbeds.github.io/serve-model-chi/), we explored some model-level optimizations for model serving. Now, we will evaluate some of the models we created in that experiment on a low-resource edge device.

Follow along at [Serving machine learning models on edge devices](https://teaching-on-testbeds.github.io/serve-edge-chi).

Note: this tutorial requires advance reservation of specific hardware! You will reserve a 2-hour block on a Raspberry Pi 5 on CHI@Edge.
